# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:

   ```
   .cursor/rules/
   ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   ├── another-rule.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

2. Follow the naming convention:

   - Use kebab-case for filenames
   - Always use .mdc extension
   - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:

   ```
   PROJECT_ROOT/
   ├── .cursor/
   │   └── rules/
   │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   │       └── ...
   └── ...
   ```

4. Never place rule files:

   - In the project root
   - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
   - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

````
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:

```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
````

6. When you update an existing rule, refresh the frontmatter so `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` still match the body of the rule.
7. Pair rule edits with the code changes that motivated them so the documentation never drifts from the implementation.

## Keeping rules current

- When project conventions shift (e.g., Tailwind utility usage, component organization), update existing rule files in the same PR as the code change.
- Summaries in rule files should reflect the latest implementation so Cursor guidance stays trustworthy.

## Editing checklist

- Confirm the change is project-wide (otherwise scope the `globs` to the affected directories).
- Note breaking or deprecated guidance in a bolded callout so it is easy to spot in Cursor’s sidebar.
- Use concise language—rules should act as reminders, not full tutorials.
- Re-run a quick search over the repo after editing to ensure references still line up with the live directory layout and dependency versions.
